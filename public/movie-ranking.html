<h1>The Best Movies According to Tatyana</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Lackawanna Blues</h3>
<p>This my favorite black movie. Black joy, the role of nannies, 
    and the racial lifestyle differences of the 1940s.</p>
<h3>Fried Green Tomatoes</h3>
<p>The movies shows aging, domestic abuse, family, lesbianism, gender inequality, and the impact 
    of racism on both black and white people. </p>
<h3>Crash</h3>
<p>Tackles the sensitive subject of racism head-on by intertwining the stories of a litany of people from both
     sides of the proverbial tracks. </p>
